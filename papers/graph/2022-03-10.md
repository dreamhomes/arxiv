**论文标题** *Max Weight Independent Set in graphs with no long claws: An analog of
  the Gyárfás' path argument*

**论文摘要** *We revisit recent developments for the Maximum Weight Independent Set problemin graphs excluding a subdivided claw 
$S_{t,t,t}$ as an induced subgraph[Chudnovsky, Pilipczuk, Pilipczuk, Thomass\'{e}, SODA 2020] and provide 
asubexponential-time algorithm with improved running time$2^{\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n}\log n)}$ and a quasipolynomial-time 
approximationscheme with improved running time $2^{\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1} \log^{5}n)}$.  The Gy\'arf\'as' path 
argument, a powerful tool that is the main buildingblock for many algorithms in $P_t$-free graphs, ensures that given 
an$n$-vertex $P_t$-free graph, in polynomial time we can find a set $P$ of atmost $t-1$ vertices, such that every 
connected component of $G-N[P]$ has atmost $n/2$ vertices. Our main technical contribution is an analog of thisresult 
for $S_{t,t,t}$-free graphs: given an $n$-vertex $S_{t,t,t}$-free graph,in polynomial time we can find a set $P$ of 
$\mathcal{O}(t \log n)$ verticesand an extended strip decomposition (an appropriate analog of the decompositioninto 
connected components) of $G-N[P]$ such that every particle (an appropriateanalog of a connected component to recurse on)
 of the said extended stripdecomposition has at most $n/2$ vertices.*

**论文标题** *Tailored vertex ordering for faster triangle listing in large graphs*  
**论文作者** *Fabrice Lécuyer,Louis Jachiet,Clémence Magnien,Lionel Tabourier*  
**发表时间** *2022-03-09*  
**论文摘要** *Listing triangles is a fundamental graph problem with many applications, andlarge graphs require fast algorithms. Vertex
 ordering allows to orient theedges from lower to higher vertex indices, and state-of-the-art trianglelisting algorithms
 use this to accelerate their execution and to bound theirtime complexity. Yet, only two basic orderings have been 
tested. In this paper,we show that studying the precise cost of algorithms instead of their boundedcomplexity leads to 
faster solutions. We introduce cost functions that linkordering properties with the running time of a given algorithm. 
We prove thattheir minimization is NP-hard and propose heuristics to obtain new orderingswith different trade-offs 
between cost reduction and ordering time. Usingdatasets with up to two billion edges, we show that our heuristics 
acceleratethe listing of triangles by an average of 30% when the ordering is alreadygiven as an input, and 15% when the 
ordering time is included.*

**论文标题** *SkinningNet: Two-Stream Graph Convolutional Neural Network for Skinning
  Prediction of Synthetic Characters*  
**论文作者** *Albert Mosella-Montoro,Javier Ruiz-Hidalgo*  
**发表时间** *2022-03-09*  
**论文摘要** *This work presents SkinningNet, an end-to-end Two-Stream Graph Neural Networkarchitecture that computes skinning weights
 from an input mesh and itsassociated skeleton, without making any assumptions on shape class andstructure of the 
provided mesh. Whereas previous methods pre-computehandcrafted features that relate the mesh and the skeleton or assume 
a fixedtopology of the skeleton, the proposed method extracts this information in anend-to-end learnable fashion by 
jointly learning the best relationship betweenmesh vertices and skeleton joints. The proposed method exploits the 
benefits ofthe novel Multi-Aggregator Graph Convolution that combines the results ofdifferent aggregators during the 
summarizing step of the Message-Passingscheme, helping the operation to generalize for unseen topologies. 
Experimentalresults demonstrate the effectiveness of the contributions of our novelarchitecture, with SkinningNet 
outperforming current state-of-the-artalternatives.*

**论文标题** *On a linear fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance for graph structured data*  
**论文作者** *Dai Hai Nguyen,Koji Tsuda*  
**发表时间** *2022-03-09*  
**论文摘要** *We present a framework for embedding graph structured data into a vectorspace, taking into account node features and 
topology of a graph into theoptimal transport (OT) problem. Then we propose a novel distance between twographs, named 
linearFGW, defined as the Euclidean distance between theirembeddings. The advantages of the proposed distance are 
twofold: 1) it can takeinto account node feature and structure of graphs for measuring the similaritybetween graphs in a
 kernel-based framework, 2) it can be much faster forcomputing kernel matrix than pairwise OT-based distances, 
particularly fusedGromov-Wasserstein, making it possible to deal with large-scale data sets.After discussing theoretical
 properties of linearFGW, we demonstrateexperimental results on classification and clustering tasks, showing 
theeffectiveness of the proposed linearFGW.*

**论文标题** *ModulE: Module Embedding for Knowledge Graphs*  
**论文作者** *Jingxuan Chai,Guangming Shi*  
**发表时间** *2022-03-09*  
**论文摘要** *Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has been shown to be a powerful tool forpredicting missing links of a knowledge graph. 
However, existing methods mainlyfocus on modeling relation patterns, while simply embed entities to vectorspaces, such 
as real field, complex field and quaternion space. To model theembedding space from a more rigorous and theoretical 
perspective, we propose anovel general group theory-based embedding framework for rotation-based models,in which both 
entities and relations are embedded as group elements.Furthermore, in order to explore more available KGE models, we 
utilize a moregeneric group structure, module, a generalization notion of vector space.Specifically, under our 
framework, we introduce a more generic embeddingmethod, ModulE, which projects entities to a module. Following the 
method ofModulE, we build three instantiating models: ModulE$_{\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}}$,ModulE$_{\mathbb{R},\mathbb{H}}$ 
and ModulE$_{\mathbb{H},\mathbb{H}}$, byadopting different module structures. Experimental results show 
thatModulE$_{\mathbb{H},\mathbb{H}}$ which embeds entities to a module overnon-commutative ring, achieves state-of-the-
art performance on multiplebenchmark datasets.*
